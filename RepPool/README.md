#Graph Pooling with Representativeness

##Usage
* To run the code, you should first generate the `*distance.txt` file using the `preprocess_distance.py` script.
* Then run `python main.py` by setting different parameters. 
* We provide examples to train our model based on different datasets in the `example.sh` file.
* `to_visual.py` is used to present the node selecting results.
